<p>Four years after the project's initiation, I have been honored last Tuesday in Prague (Czech Republic), in PostSharp's home country, to announce the availability of the first stable release. This release can be download from our <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/download/1.0/">download section</a>.</p>


 <p>Although everyone knows that a software of this complexity is never completely bug-free, the last release candidate has been very stable and all fixes required only minor, local and safe modifications.</p> <p>The 1.0 branch now becomes a legacy branch. It will further maintained as long as another branch does not reach a higher level of stability. </p> <p>This version is therefore one you can rely on.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
