<p>Just a quick note to say we’ve fixed the PostSharp Toolkits so that you can build them from source code. Previously, some artifacts were hardcoded to our development environment.</p>


  <p>Note that the objective of the toolkits is to provide you with ready-made implementations, so we encourage you downloading the NuGet packages instead of building from source code.</p>  <p>In order to build the toolkits, follow these steps:</p>  <h2>1. Download the source code from GitHub</h2> Clone the repository <a title="git://github.com/sharpcrafters/PostSharp-Toolkits.git" href="git://github.com/sharpcrafters/PostSharp-Toolkits.git">git://github.com/sharpcrafters/PostSharp-Toolkits.git</a> or download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/sharpcrafters/PostSharp-Toolkits">https://github.com/sharpcrafters/PostSharp-Toolkits</a>.   <h2>2. Install PostSharp</h2> You need PostSharp to build the toolkits, but we don’t use NuGet to retrieve it from the network. This is because the build script needs to be compatible with our development environment. The minimal version number of PostSharp you need is specified in the <em>dependencies</em> section of the file $\Build\NuGet\Logging\PostSharpDiagnosticsToolkit.nuspec.   <p>If you’ve installed PostSharp with the setup program, you can go to the next step. Otherwise, you need to create a file named $\Dependencies\PostSharp\PostSharpDir.Custom.targets, which specifies where PostSharp is installed. Note that this file should not be checked into the source control.</p>  <p>Here is the content of this file for our development environment:</p>  <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Project ToolsVersion=&quot;4.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot;&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;PostSharpDir&gt;c:\src\PostSharp-2.1\Build\bin&lt;/PostSharpDir&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;</pre>

<h2>3. Build from Visual Studio or MSBuild</h2>

<p>At this point, you will probably want to open the solution PostSharp.Toolkits.sln and build it. </p>

<h2>4. Build the NuGet packages</h2>

<p>When all binaries are built, you can create the NuGet packages by calling</p>

<pre>msbuild Build\NuGet\NuGet.proj</pre>

<h2>The usual disclaimer</h2>

<p>Of course, this blog post has to come with the usual disclaimer that PostSharp Diagnostic Toolkit uses PostSharp SDK, which is officially undocumented and unsupported. That is, we are happy to show you how things work, but we won’t answer questions related to its implementation. The source code of the toolkits itself is largely undocumented and is provided AS IS, and we won’t accept this kind of criticisms.</p>

<p> Happy PostSharping!</p>
