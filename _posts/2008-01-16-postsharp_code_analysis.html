<p>An <a href="http://blogs.rev-net.com/ddewinter/?p=30">interesting post</a> of David DeWinter showing how difficult it is to use FxCop/VSTS Code Analysis when PostSharp is enabled. Indeed, PostSharp does not respect all FxCop rules, and does not emit rule-disabling custom attributes.

</p>


<p>David shows how to run FxCop before PostSharp, which involves some serious changes in MSBuild files.

</p><p>Seems like a worry for the next version of PostSharp...
