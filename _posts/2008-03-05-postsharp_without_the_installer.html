<p>If you belong to those who don&#39;t like global installations, the
 <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/blog/2008/02/announcing-postsharp-10-rc-2.html">
 latest release candidate</a> should make you happy: there is now a binary 
 distribution without installer.</p>



 <p>This distribution should remove much of the mystery about how PostSharp 
 integrates in the build process. Actually, since the installer does not 
 modify the MSBuild target files for you, you have to do it yourself. The 
 interesting thing is that you can do it in a per-project basis: instead of 
 modifying global MSBuild target files, you can just import PostSharp in the 
 projects that actually need it.</p>
 <p>If you think this kind of installation is for you, <a href="/download">
 download</a> the <strong>&#39;Binary - No Installer&#39;</strong> package, and read 
 carefully the installation instructions in the file <strong>
 doc/Build-Instructions.html</strong>.</p>
 <p>Since this kind of distribution is quite new, I am looking forward for 
 your comments.<br>
 <br>
 Happy PostSharping!<br>
 <br>
 Gael</p>
