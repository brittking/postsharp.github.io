<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that I&rsquo;ll participate as a speaker to the <a href="http://www.ndc-london.com/" target="_blank">first NDC London</a>. I&rsquo;ll be delivering my talk pretentiously named <em>You Thought You Understood Multithreading</em>, a deep dive that starts from the <em>lock</em> keyword and CPU microarchitecture and the Windows kernel.</p>



<p style="align:center"><a href="http://www.ndc-london.com"><img src="/assets/images/blog/2013-10-09-ndc_london_2013/ndc_london_topp_early_bird_2013.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know the NDC concept: this is an awesome combination of top-notch content and undeniable fun. The serious side is taken care of by a wide board of speakers, ranging from recognized personalities such as Robert Martin and Scott Guthrie to less known innovators (like me!) and luminaries.</p>
<p>As for entertainment, the NDC team could not find a better partner than Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell from .NET Rocks. I can only talk of what I&rsquo;ve seen the last time I was at NDC. This was in Oslo in June 2011, two months before the twins got born and the two-years self-inflicted house arrest that followed. Richard kicked off the party by the hilarious story of how the teenager he was acquired a 4MB hard drive (as huge as a washing machine) and filled it with&hellip; ASCII p0rn. Then Richard joined with guitars and they start playing, guess what&hellip; rock! They are not named .NET Rocks without a reason. The second half of the evening was guaranteed by a local rock band. I forgot the name, and just remember I was picked by the security team after having tied the laces of the lead singer&rsquo;s shoes and taken him on my shoulders. Hem. I didn&rsquo;t know I was so strong. I was happy to wake up fresh enough to give my talk in the first slot of the next morning.</p>
<p>Lesson taken: you don&rsquo;t want to miss the NDC party, but as the speaker you don&rsquo;t want the first slot after the party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be in London between December 4th and December 6th. If you want to meet up, discuss how you love PostSharp or how it sucks, please <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/company/team/gael" target="_blank">contact me</a> and we&rsquo;ll set up a date. And make sure to attend my talk on Thursday.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
