I am pleased to announce the third release candidate of PostSharp 1.0,
<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/download">available for download</a>. This
is also the last release candidate, which means that I would gladly promote
it to the status of stable release if no bug is reported.</p>




<p class="t-left">
Indeed, RC2 proved to be very stable. Among the
reported issues, very few affected core
components. Most efforts have been directed to a
better integration with MSBuild and a better
packaging.</p>

<p class="t-left">
Let me cite a few improvements you can be looking forward:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Improved
Compile-Time Performance</strong>: Compiling
PostSharp samples is 65% faster with RC3 than
with RC2 if you use the standard Windows
Installer. No real magic here: since PostSharp
is stable enough, we now ship the release
build instead of the debug build.
Additionally, PostSharp is now correctly
configured to use native images.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Improved User Guide</strong>:
There is now a full end-user documentation of
the PostSharp Platform and PostSharp Laos.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Improved Packaging</strong>:
The installer does not place assemblies in GAC
any more. The no-installer package is now
fully-featured with documentation and samples.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Samples Browser</strong>:
Documentation and source code of samples are
now better integrated. You can open a sample
into Visual Studio directly from the samples
documentation browser.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Support for
References to .NET 1.0</strong>: There is now
a workaround that makes PostSharp accept
assemblies (generally third-party
dependencies) compiled for the .NET Framework
version 1.0 or 1.1. </p>
</li>

<li>

<p class="t-left"><strong>Compatibility with
VSTS Unit Tests</strong>: VSTS Unit Test will
not complain of artifacts generated by
PostSharp any more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
