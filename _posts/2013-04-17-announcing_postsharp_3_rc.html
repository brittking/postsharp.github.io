<p>Weâ€™re happy to announce that PostSharp 3 has finally reached the RC quality band. This means that it is now sufficiently documented, internal testing is completed, all known bugs (except some minor ones) have been fixed, and the rate of new bug reports has significantly decreased. We plan to move to RTW with two weeks, unless important bugs delay this objective.</p>


 <p>It is now a good time for small teams to upgrade to the new versions. The procedure is described in <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/postsharp-3.0/##PostSharp-3.0.chm/html/1530becd-2bf4-470e-9e8e-31c16fdd01ec.htm" target="_blank">our online documentation</a>. We are planning more articles and webinars regarding upgrades and deployment of PostSharp 3 in the next weeks.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
