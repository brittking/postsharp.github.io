<p>We have just doubled the amount of RAM available to the PostSharp server.

<p>Guess what is the server configuration? What do you think a Microsoft-centric open-source project runs on?

<p>Well... a Linux/Debian virtual server (Xen) running Apache, Mono, phpbb, wordpress, mantis and htdig! Daily backup using rsync. Try to have the same feature for less than 35 EUR a month on Windows!
