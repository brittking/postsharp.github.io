<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t yet subscribe to <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com" target="_blank">.NET Rocks!</a> and its training video counterpart, <a href="http://dnrtv.com/" target="_blank">dnrTV</a>, you&rsquo;re missing out on some wonderfully entertaining and informative talk shows.</p>
<p>Since 2002, Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell have been speaking with guests about programming in Microsoft .NET and, after nearly 650 episodes, show no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Gael was invited to be on .NET Rocks! in early February but, due to a bad phone line, he had to reschedule. Luckily both he and Carl attended this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/Presenting-AOP-at-the-New-York-City-code-camp.aspx" target="_blank">NYC Code Camp</a>, where they could finally sit down and record face-to-face. Or so he thought&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=640" target="_blank">Listen to the first few minutes of the podcast</a> to learn how Carl and Richard were finally able to record the show with Gael. Then, after you&rsquo;ve had a good chuckle, continue listening to the podcast to learn more about programming with aspects.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DotNet Rocks" src="/assets/images/blog/2011-03-26-carl_franklin_and_richard_campbell_rock!/dotnet rocks_1.png" border="0" alt="DotNet Rocks" width="269" height="79"></a></p>
<p>Listen to the podcast: <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=640">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=640</a></p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<p><strong>10:32 &ndash; What is an aspect?</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:10 &ndash; Using PostSharp for more than just Tracing and Logging</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:12 &ndash; Why having a bug in your aspect is safer than in the implementation of the manual line</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:20 &ndash; Two multithreading issues that can be solved using aspects</strong></p>
<p><strong>25:41 &ndash; Richard&rsquo;s favorite example of AOP</strong></p>
<p><strong>36:43 &ndash; Static versus Dynamic AOP</strong></p>
<p><strong>40:08 &ndash; What&rsquo;s next for PostSharp</strong></p>
<h2>Show the Code.</h2>
<p><a href="http://dnrtv.com/dnrtvplayer/player.aspx?ShowNum=0190" target="_blank">Gael also recorded a PostSharp demonstration with Carl on dnrTV.</a> The shows on dnrTV are equally as entertaining as those on .NET Rocks! but with one very important difference: the code!</p>
<p>In this webcast-like format, guests are able to demonstrate technical topics in greater detail. That&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;ll see in the recording with Gael as he dives deep into PostSharp &ndash; showing both common and advanced aspect usage.</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>
<p><strong>02:10 &ndash; TraceArgumentsAspect : OnExceptionAspect</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:47 &ndash; TracePerformanceAspect : OnMethodBoundaryAspect</strong></p>
<p><strong>23:15 &ndash; CacheAttribute : MethodInterceptionAspect</strong></p>
<p><strong>45:57 &ndash; Undo/Redo</strong></p>
<p>Special thanks to Carl and Richard for inviting Gael as a guest on both shows. And many thanks to all of you who watched the shows and provided feedback. Keep it coming.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
