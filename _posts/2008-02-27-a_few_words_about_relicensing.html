<p>I have been quite laconic in the release announcement about relicensing. Much 
more was said on the <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/about/license/">licensing 
page</a>, but yet I got some feedback that it was not clear.</p>



<p>The summary of PostSharp licensing is: <strong>Runtime libraries are released 
under the non-viral LGPL license; compile-time components are released under 
GPL.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that
<span style="font-size: medium; color: #6182D1"><strong>chances are great that 
relicensing changes nothing to your life</strong></span>. Indeed, programs that
<em>are transformed</em> by PostSharp are <em>not</em> contaminated by GPL, 
since they reference only runtime libraries of PostSharp. Basically, if your 
program does not need the library <em>PostSharp.Core.dll</em> to be present on 
your customer&#39;s computer, using PostSharp does not affect your program&#39;s 
licensing scheme at all. And I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the case of 99% of users.</p>
<p>So who is impacted by the GPL license? Well, people who develop programs that 
use PostSharp to modify other assemblies. In other words: if your program 
transform the programs of your customers, read on. </p>
<p>Anyway, what kind of programs modify other programs? There are two typical 
families of products that fall in that category: O-R mappers, obfuscators, 
optimizers, code generators are the first one; they are typically deployed only 
on development machines. Another family includes application servers offering 
aspect-oriented services (AFAIK there is <em>none</em> for .NET, but in the Java 
world it&#39;s quite common for an application server to have an integrated AOP 
engine). Of course a special member of that family is the still-unreleased 
Starcounter object database server; deploying .NET assemblies to this server 
will make classes &quot;magically&quot; persistent in a server environment.</p>
<p>What if your program uses core parts of PostSharp? Actually, you are not 
automatically infected by GPL. You have the following options:</p>
<ul>
 <li>If you don&#39;t distribute your work outside of your company, you are not 
 infected. So if you make an in-house plug-in, you are okay.</li>
 <li>You can release your work under any license approved by the
 <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>. Well, 
 attention: all your work, and not only the assembly directly referencing 
 PostSharp.</li>
 <li>You can acquire a commercial license, which is basically a GPL exemption 
 for your products. Exemptions will be provided on an individual, per-product 
 basis. Since the number of customer of these licenses is quite small, 
 exemptions will be given as a part of a partnership program including 
 support and NDA. The idea there is to have a few good customers with a 
 strong relationship. The &quot;masses&quot; have the product for free (anyway with a 
 level of support often quoted as better than commercial one).</li>
</ul>
<p>An important point is that <strong>the licensing itself is in &#39;candidate&#39; 
phase</strong>. If it makes you feel badly, do not hesitate to react. The point 
is that, given the size and the complexity of the product, it is not possible 
any more to develop and support it exclusively during free time, so I must raise 
some money. I would like the product to be supported by few key partners having 
a strong interest in PostSharp, and let it free for most (99%) people.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
