  <p>A good reason to upgrade is that it brings <strong>important runtime performance improvements</strong> in<strong> </strong>PostSharp Laos thanks to better caching of calls to System.Reflection and thanks to a custom implementation of Delegate.DynamicInvoke (the default implementation provided by the .NET base library, relying on dynamic invocation through System.Reflection, is just shameful).</p>  <p>This version is <strong>side-to-side compatible with PostSharp 1.5</strong>. Pay attention to this <strong>breaking change</strong>: the version number of PostSharp libraries now does <em>not</em> contain the revision and build numbers anymore, so the new version is 1.0.0.0. When referencing PostSharp libraries from your projects, you need to enable the &quot;Specific Version&quot; property of the reference.</p>  <p>Bad news is that all plug-ins have to be recompiled so that they have the proper version number; good news is that this is the last time, since later maintenance releases won't change the version number any more.</p>  <p>(Note that the <em>file version</em> still contains the revision and build numbers, so you can always check what version you are running.)</p>  <p>As promised, there is no change in the license and this version will continue to be maintained until 1.5 becomes stable.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
