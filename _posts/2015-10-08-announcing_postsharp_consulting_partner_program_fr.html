<p>We’re excited to announce the launch of the PostSharp Consulting Partner program, an initiative designed to increase our cooperation with IT consulting and custom development companies. </p>


<p>If you build software for your customers, the PostSharp Consulting Program is for you!</p><p>Everybody starts at Gold level. As an entry gift, each partner will receive a <strong>free PostSharp Ultimate license </strong>and then a <strong>40% discounts</strong> on the first 5 licenses purchased for your team. Additionally, you will be able to purchase additional licenses for yourself and your customers with a <strong>reseller-grade discount</strong>.</p><p>As a consultancy, PostSharp helps you deliver high-quality applications at lower cost and faster so that you can <strong>close more deals</strong> and meet your deadlines. Sure, there is no silver bullet, and software engineering will always be hard work. But PostSharp allows you to avoid writing repeating code – and the effort and defects that come with it.</p><p>In exchange of the discount, we at PostSharp expect to have tight communication with our partners. We want to hear from your projects, from your successes with PostSharp, and from your difficulties. And because we take it seriously, we are offering <strong>free technical consulting </strong>(reasonably - until supplies last) with an engineer (actually with me in the beginning).</p><p>To learn more about this program, <a href="http://partners.postsharp.net/consulting-partner/"><strong>visit our PostSharp Partner Portal</strong></a>.</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
