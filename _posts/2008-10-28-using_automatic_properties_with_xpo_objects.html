<p>It seems that making ORM easier to work with becomes one of the killer apps of PostSharp. </p>


 <p>There were already PostSharp aspects for DataObjects.NET, Starcounter and NHibernate. Sean Kearon has now developed a library for <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/">Express Persistent Object</a> (XPO).</p> <p>For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xpoautoproperties">CodePlex project page</a> and his <a href="http://kearon.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-c-automatic-properties-with-xpo_27.html">blog</a>.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
