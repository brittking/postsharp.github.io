<p>I’m happy we finally refreshed our <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp/download" target="_blank">front-page download</a> and released PostSharp 2.1 SP 1, featuring 48 bug fixes and user stories.</p>


  <p>All fixes were already available under the “download” section, so it’s not that anyone had to wait so long to get a solution. </p>  <p>This service packs solves virtually all defects that have been reported to us, most notably:</p>  <ul>   <li>compatibility with Code Analysis (FxCop) – the infamous file locking issue</li>    <li>compatibility with Code Contracts (issues with debugging symbols)</li>    <li>compatibility with Silverlight 5</li>    <li>issues in PostSharp HQ when upgrading PostSharp</li> </ul>  <p>This makes this release a very stable one. For a list of all fixes, see the <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/downloads/postsharp-2.1/sp-1/PostSharp-ReleaseNotes-2.1.6.4.html" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>  <p>The SP 1 contains the following new enhancements:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/Feature-Focus-View-source-code-enhanced-by-PostSharp.aspx" target="_blank">View source code enhanced by PostSharp</a> from Visual Studio using your favorite decompiler.</li>    <li>Example code migrated to Visual Studio 2010 and cleaned up, licensing under BSD 2.0.</li>    <li>Refresh (actually, revival) of the XML project system:</li>    <ul>     <li>Unification of plug-in configuration (psplugin) and project configuration (psproj).</li>      <li>Support for services that do not refer to PostSharp.Sdk.dll.</li>      <li>Support for data islands inside XML project files.</li>   </ul>    <li>Adding aspects (actually, MulticastAttribute) to an XML project file – so without changing anything to source code.</li> </ul>  <p>The last few enhancements can appear a little cryptic to you, but they open the way to a new line of features we’ll blob about from next weeks: PostSharp Toolkits. They will make it easier to use the power of PostSharp without the difficulty of learning aspect-oriented programming.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
