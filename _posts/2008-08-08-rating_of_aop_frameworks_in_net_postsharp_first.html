<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/AOP_Frameworks_Rating.aspx">Gnanasekaran's study</a> rates PostSharp first with a 95% score! PIAB and Spring.NET come second and third.</p>


  <p>Although the source is not very authoritative and has a pretty restricted set of comparison points, I hope there is at least some truth under PostSharp's pole position :-).</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
