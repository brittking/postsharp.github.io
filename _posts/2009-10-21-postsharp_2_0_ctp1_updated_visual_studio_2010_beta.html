<p>We have <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/all-downloads/postsharp-2.0">refreshed</a> PostSharp 2.0 CTP with a bunch of bug fixes and, most importantly, support for Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 and .NET 4.0 Beta 2.</p>


<p>The PostSharp Add-In for Visual Studio currently don't work with Visual Studio 2010, but you should be able to build projects targetting all versions of the .NET Framework.</p><p>Note that the pipe server currently does not work with .NET 4.0.</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
