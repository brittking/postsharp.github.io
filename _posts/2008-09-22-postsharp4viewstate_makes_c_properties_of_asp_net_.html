<p>The days where AOP was limited to the academic samples of tracing and authorization are definitely over!</p>


 <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/szymonpobiega">Szymon Pobiega</a> has released <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PostSharp4ViewState">PostSharp4ViewState</a> on CodePlex. This PostSharp plug-in defines a new custom attribute <strong>[Persist]</strong>. When you apply it to an instance property of an ASP.NET page of control, it will simply... persist it in the state view!</p> <p>Under the hood, PostSharp4ViewState implements the methods <b>LoadControlState</b> and <strong>SaveControlState</strong>.</p> <p>For more information, please read the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/viewstate/PostSharp4ViewState.aspx">PostSharp4ViewState Code Project article</a>. And don't forget to give him a good vote ;-).</p> <p></p> <p>Thank you Szymon for this great plug-in, and congratulations!</p> <p></p>-gael
