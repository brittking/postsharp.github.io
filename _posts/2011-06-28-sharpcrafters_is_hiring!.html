  <p><strong>Things have been going well</strong> for SharpCrafters since its commercial launch in March 2010. We have been profitable since day one and have enjoyed 15 months of healthy, organic growth. It wasn't easy transitioning from open-source to commercial, but we managed to keep (mostly) everyone happy by striking the right balance between the pricing of our Pro Edition and the free features of our Starter Edition. We discovered that our real challenge is not in selling a commercial product, but in driving adoption of aspect-oriented programming in the .NET community. To meet this challenge, we made a huge evangelism effort (in total <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/community/events" target="_blank">35 AOP talks in just 6 months</a> thanks to our friends) that culminated at NDC 2011, where AOP made its first appearance with a dedicated track at a major conference. This would not have been possible without Britt King, our Communications Director, who joined SharpCrafters in September 2010.</p>  <p><strong>We have come to understand our customers better</strong>: not only by industry, but by the technical problems they face and why they turn to PostSharp for solutions. Two industries are distinctly preeminent: financial services (Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale…) healthcare (Philips, Siemens, Oracle…). Nearer to the software industry itself: Intel, eBay, NetApp, FullArmor, Telligent and SolidWorks, among others.</p>  <p><strong>We have learned from our customers</strong>: how PostSharp allows them to reduce complexity in their code so that junior developers can do a better job faster – reducing the amount of system knowledge needed by new team members before being productive.</p>  <p><strong>Now is our time to grow!</strong> We plan to move to new, larger offices in the center of Prague, and have made plans to build a larger team. If you’re a software developer living in Prague or its surrounding area, and want to work in a company that is changing the way your peer developers think about their code… you really don’t want to miss this opportunity.</p>  <p>See our job post: <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/company/jobs" target="_blank">SharpCrafters is Hiring a Software Engineer</a>.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
