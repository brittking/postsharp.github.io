<p>If you already use PostSharp Laos in any project, internal or external,
   <strong>I would like to hear from you</strong> and there is a chance for your 
   company to get some (limited) visibility!</p>



<p>I am writing an article for the <a href="http://aosd.net/2008/">AOSD 2008</a> 
   conference and I would like to augment my paper with case study (in 
   technical, not commercial wordings). The case study will then be published 
   separately on the website and eventually mentioned at other conferences.</p>
<p>So, if you think you did something interesting with PostSharp, <strong>please</strong> 
   get back to me, I really need your feedback!</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Gael</p>
