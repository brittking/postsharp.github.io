<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to be selected as a speaker for <a href="http://nyc.codecamp.us/">NYC Code Camp 2011</a> on February 19th. You&rsquo;ll find me in the Radio City room at 9h15. I'll deliver my introduction talk <strong>Produce Cleaner Code with Aspect-Oriented Programming</strong>.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ll be in Manhattan from Wednesday evening till Sunday afternoon. If you don&rsquo;t attend the code camp and want to meet up, please contact me by email (<a href="mailto:gael@sharpcrafters.com">gael@sharpcrafters.com</a>) or by phone at +420&nbsp;775011188.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ll cross the Atlantic so I feel a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_in_America" target="_blank">Tintin in America</a>. I&rsquo;ve been in the land of Soviets and Congo (although I lived Congo before visiting Russia), so I&rsquo;m pretty much respecting the order of the series. <br><br><br>Next stop: the Cigars of Pharaoh?</p>
