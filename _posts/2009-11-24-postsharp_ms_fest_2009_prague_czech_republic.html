<p>I'll present PostSharp and Aspect-Oriented Programming at <a href="http://www.ms-fest.cz/">MS Fest 2009</a>, taking place in Prague, Czech Republic, this week-end (November 28th and 29th), and organized by students of the Math-Phys Institute of the&nbsp;Charles University.</p>


<p>My presentation will be in Czech -- I'm getting used to be the only one not to make the show in his mother tongue (mine is French)...</p><p>There will be a lot of fun! I gave the same presentation in Munich, Germany last month, and it was considered an homage to Mr Bean! No, seriously guys, AOP is serious stuff!</p><p>-gael</p>
