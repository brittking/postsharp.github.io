<p><em>The 'Week of PostSharp' is a joint promotion with <a href="http://www.manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning Publications </a>where we highlight a new book each day that is special to us and hand-picked by the PostSharp team &ndash; with a small introduction about how it connects to what we are doing. We also collaborated with Manning to select a second book for each day of the week, and will be offering our choices at a 50% discount on their site! You can even read excerpts from some of the books online for free by clicking on the links below.</em></p>



<p><em>We hope you enjoy the deals! We&rsquo;ll be adding new posts with the daily discount code throughout the week, so stay tuned.</em></p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a strange secret affair between Microsoft and Aspect-Oriented Programming. Never, ever has Microsoft used the word Aspect-Oriented Programming in its products. Yet, many products implement some of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET MVC (filters)</li>
<li>ASP.NET (modules)</li>
<li>WCF (custom behaviors)</li>
<li>Unity (interceptors)</li>
<li>Policy Injection Application Block (policy)</li>
<li>Base Class Library (transparent proxy, ContextBoundObject)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking twice, it&rsquo;s fair enough that Microsoft never called that aspect-oriented programming. After all, with the exception of ASP.NET MVC, these are quite purpose-specific implementations of one or two design patterns: pipes-and-filters, or proxies. But with ASP.NET MVC, they got pretty close.</p>
<p>Get convinced yourself with the books of the day which <strong>you can now purchase with a 50% discount</strong>&nbsp;- but hurry, the offering is valid only <strong>until August 22th, 12 midnight EST</strong>:</p>
