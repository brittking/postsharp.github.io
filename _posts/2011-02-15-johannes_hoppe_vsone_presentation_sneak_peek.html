<p>We recently caught up with <a href="http://twitter.com/johanneshoppe">Johannes Hoppe</a>, who will speak at VSone on February 17th, invited him for a chat about his session on Aspect-Oriented Programming, and convinced him to give our German readers a sneak preview.</p>

<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Why did you choose to speak about Aspect-Oriented Programming at VSone?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: <em>The Clean Code movement has really taken off in Germany in the past few years and writing pragmatic clean code is something I&rsquo;m passionate about. I shifted to aspect-oriented programming on some projects recently and have been amazed at the number of lines of code it has saved me. I wanted to share these insights with VSone attendees.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Why should VSone attendees care about AOP?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: <em>For the same reason they care about clean code. AOP is an effective way to produce cleaner code and I believe it deserves to be used by more developers. Developers attend events like VSone because they&rsquo;re looking for quick wins &ndash; learning things that they can implement right away &ndash; and my presentation is perfect for developers who want a quick introduction to Aspect-Oriented Programming. During the presentation I&rsquo;ll show some production-ready aspects that I&rsquo;ve prepared and make them available to attendees for download so they can start to use them right away in their own code. </em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: What was your first experience with AOP?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: <em>Early last year I was working on a project that had a tight deadline. My team had done unit tests and they all showed green but we still felt something wasn&rsquo;t quite right. My boss told us to do a soft release and we sent 300 visitors (from a mailing list) to the website and the webserver nearly exploded. </em></p>
<p><em>We smartly decided not to go live with the project and instead looked at where the peaks were coming from. That was the first time I used AOP. We made a summary of the method runtimes and I used an aspect to log the method execution times to find the problem &ndash; a mistake on one of the most frequently used methods which made everything super slow &ndash; and later used a caching aspect to fix it. I&rsquo;ve been addicted ever since.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Have you ever lectured about AOP to your students?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: <em>No, not yet! My previous lectures have been about other topics but I&rsquo;m hoping to introduce it in an upcoming &ldquo;Software Architecture and Development&rdquo; course. In the meantime my students are using &ldquo;AOP- flavored&rdquo; code without knowing it &ndash; for example the ASP.NET MVC HandleError Attribute and the Dependency Attribute from Unity. I like it when aspects are unobtrusive.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: What will VSone attendees see in your presentation that&rsquo;s not shown in your sneak preview?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: In addition to the introduction to AOP and showing how to make messy code clean again using common AOP patterns, a<em>ttendees will see a live example of a logging aspect &ndash; I&rsquo;ll show how easy it is to apply &ndash; followed by validation and caching aspects in real world scenarios. If there is time, I&rsquo;d love to show my </em><em><a href="http://blog.johanneshoppe.de/2011/01/findstackoverlowattribute-vs-stackoverlowexception/">StackOverflow aspect</a></em><em>that finds unwanted recursion, including a real world disaster story of when it showed up in my life.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Where can our readers learn more about you?</p>
<p><em>My blog is a good start: </em><a href="http://blog.johanneshoppe.de/">http://blog.johanneshoppe.de/</a><em>. I&rsquo;m planning to publish some articles in print magazines soon, too. Readers can also go to my ADO.NET Unit Testable Repository Generator: </em><a href="http://repositorygenerator.codeplex.com/"><em>http://repositorygenerator.codeplex.com/</em></a><em> which is something I&rsquo;m quite proud of.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Which technologies interest you most and why?</p>
<p><strong>Johannes</strong>: <em>My daily work covers a lot of Microsoft technologies. At the moment I&rsquo;m concentrated on ASP.NET MVC &ndash; the best MS platform for building websites, EXT.NET framework &ndash; a great tool for building RIA apps really fast, and Windows Phone 7 development. Microsoft gave me two Windows Phone 7s for &rdquo;free,&rdquo; one as a finalist in the Imagine Cup and the other one I got for my Microsoft Student Partner Program efforts. Now I have to develop something for it. </em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: Which sessions are you planning to attend at VSone?</p>
<p><em>There are so many good sessions at the same time it&rsquo;s hard to decide which to attend. I will definitely go to Rouven Haban&rsquo;s session &ldquo;ASP.NET MVC in Practice.&rdquo; In which he will talk about one of his recent projects of which I&rsquo;m very interested. Thankfully his session is an hour before mine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Britt</strong>: What&rsquo;s this I hear about you and footbagging?</p>
<p><em>I was VERY into footbagging a few years ago and loved it so much that I built a footbag online shop </em><a href="http://www.footbag-shop.de/"><em>http://www.footbag-shop.de/</em></a><em>and later realized their potential as marketing vehicles </em><a href="http://www.promotion-footbags.de/"><em>http://www.promotion-footbags.de/</em></a><em>. Footbagging is still one of my favorite outdoor games to play during breaks. Whenever I find some time, I like to make that little ball dance with my feet. I can&rsquo;t wait for spring, it&rsquo;s the best time for footbagging really!</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Britt</em></strong><em>: You had me at &ldquo;very.&rdquo;</em></p>
