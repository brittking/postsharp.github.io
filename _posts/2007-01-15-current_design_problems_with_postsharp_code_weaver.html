<p>As I wrote two posts ago, I discovered some design problems with both PostSharp aspect weavers: the low-level one and Laos, the high-level one.



<p>I have written a log of improvement proposals in the <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap">PostSharp Roadmap</a>:
</p>
<p><ul><li>                     <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap/28" title="When there are many 'catch' or 'finally' advices, the method body should be transformed using many nested 'try' blocks, one for each advice. Additionally, it should be possible to 'ignore' an exception, i.e. avoid it being rethrown.">#28: Low-level code weaver: better support for multiple catch/finally advices.</a>                    <span class="discreet">                    (G. Fraiteur)                    </span></li><li>                     <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap/29" title="The low-level weaver now only support untyped catch advices (i.e. the caught type is Exception). It should enable to specify which kind of exception should be caugt.">#29: Low-level code weaver: support for typed catches</a>                    <span class="discreet">                    (G. Fraiteur)                    </span></li><li>                     <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap/30" title="To add a new family of join points: BeforeGetAddressOfField, AfterGetAddressOfField, InsteadOfGetAddressOfField.">#30: Low-level code weaver: new join point Before/After/InsteadOf Load Field Address</a>                    <span class="discreet">                    (G. Fraiteur)                    </span></li><li>                     <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap/31" title="The OnExceptionAspect and OnMethodBoundaryAspect should be able to ignore exceptions, i.e. to avoid exceptions being rethrown.">#31: Laos: to ignore exceptions </a><span class="discreet">                    (O. Conijn, G. Fraiteur)                    </span></li><li>                     <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/projects/postsharp/roadmap/32" title="When a multicasted custom attribute instance is applied to an element that has already an instance, the old instance should be ignored and the new instance should be used instead.">#32: Multicasting of custom attributes: complete overwriting (not partial any more)</a>                    <span class="discreet">                    (G. Fraiteur)</span></li></ul>Since most are breaking changes, I would like to implement them before Beta 1. I know some users already rely on these features. That's why I invite them to send feedback to share their opinion. Please use the <span style="font-style: italic;">add comment</span> feature of the website for this (not this blog post).

<p>Thank you.
