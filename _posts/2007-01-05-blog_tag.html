<a href="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/olaf/archive/2007/01/05/tagged.aspx">Olaf got me</a><p> in the game. He decided to loose my time.

For the things you know, my personal marketing material is on </p>


<a href="http://gael.fraiteur.net/">http://gael.fraiteur.net</a>. But shhht, that's for headhunters!

Five things you don't know about me?
<ol><li>I have lived 3 years in ex-Zaire (current R.D. Congo). How not to get bored when school ends at 1 PM? At the age of 11, I felt too old to play the whole afternoon in the swimming pool. Hopefully my father brought a computer home and I could start... programming.</li><li>I don't have any wisdom tooth. Maybe I am not wise enough.</li><li>As Olaf, I don't have the driving license. The difference is that I am older (28) and have two children. And a wife, but I don't have to bear her.</li><li>I got respected by my Czech colleagues when I started to speak as vulgarly as them. It took me three years of full immersion to reach this level of linguistic refinement.</li><li>I know 'personally' really little bloggers. Less than five! So I have to tag people I don't even know.</li></ol>I suppose these read my blog:

<a href="http://cs.rthand.com/blogs/blog_with_righthand/default.aspx">Miha Markic</a>, <a href="http://x-tensive.blogspot.com/">Alex Yakunin</a>, <a href="http://evain.net/blog/xml/rss20/feed.xml">JB Evain</a>

I would add Per but he does not blog...

I just hope I will not get damned for having partially broken the chain!<em></em>
