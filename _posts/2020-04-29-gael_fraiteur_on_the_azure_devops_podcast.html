<p class="MsoNormal">Gael was speaking about his journey with PostSharp ever since 2004, which started as an open-source project. His early vision was to to build an aspect-oriented software that would offer .NET developers the same productivity benefits as those enjoyed by Java community. &nbsp;</p>
