<p><span style="color: #000000;">When I first moved to Prague in 2004 I heard many tales from locals about the devastation caused by the </span><span style="color: #000000;">floods of 2002 which </span><span style="color: #000000;">killed 17 people, forced tens of thousands from their homes and caused several billion dollars of damage across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I heard tales of rescue: brave souls risking their own lives to save elderly neighbors and pets. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Tales of losing it all: families without homes and cars; historic photo albums, artwork and libraries of books now gone forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And tales of starting over: communities coming together in solidarity to rebuild their lives; a city slowly restoring to its former beauty, one street at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I remember thinking to myself, &ldquo;thank god flooding like that only happens every 100 years.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Just yesterday, </span>Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas declared a state of emergency for most of the nation as swollen rivers caused by days of heavy rain threatened Prague's historic center and forced evacuations from low-lying areas.</p>
<p>And the waters are STILL rising.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In an effort to support the beautiful city to which we call home, and all those affected by the current Prague flooding, <strong>PostSharp Technologies is donating 50% of all online purchases to a local flood relief fund from now until the state of emergency is lifted.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Please keep the city of Prague and the Czech nation in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time, and we will keep you updated on Twitter as news comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now is our chance to be part of a new tale.</span></p>
