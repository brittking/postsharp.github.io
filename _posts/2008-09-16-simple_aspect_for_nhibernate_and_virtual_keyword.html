<p>An untraditional aspect of the PostSharp activist <a href="http://herrmic-coding.blogspot.com/">Michal Dabrowski</a>:</p>


 <blockquote> <p>People who use NHibernate know that in order to take advantage of its lazy-loading facility, all public members of the persisted classes must be marked as <code>virtual</code>. Compared to all the benefits the lazy-loading brings, this seems to be a very insignificant price. However, for some people, including me, this extra <code>virtual</code> keyword is still some annoyance. It is very easy to forget about it when writing a new code, it makes Resharper complain sometimes ("virtual member call in constructor" warning) and it is ugly (subjective one, I know). In this article I would like to show how to solve these issues with a simple aspect, that makes members <code>virtual</code> even if the keyword is not used in the source code.</p></blockquote> <p>Read the complete article on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Unsealer.aspx">Code Project</a>.</p>
