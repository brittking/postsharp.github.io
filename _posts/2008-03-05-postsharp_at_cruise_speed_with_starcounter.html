<p>I am happy to announce that I started this week a long-term partnership
 with Starcounter AB, a Stockholm-based software shop producing a next-generation
 object database management system (ODBMS) that will make you understand the 
 benefits of 64-bit hardware. I am not allowed to give too much details, but 
 I&#39;ll sure do it once it will go public. Believe me, it sounds cool!</p>



 <p>The good thing for PostSharp is that the partnership plans to reserve 40% 
 of regular working time to PostSharp development. To be more precise, I will 
 work in the average 3 days a week for Starcounter, but at a rate that allows 
 me to invest the rest of the time in PostSharp.</p>
 <p>Starcounter is already a old partner of PostSharp. Contacts started in 
 June 2006, when they started considering PostSharp in their product. In 
 November 2006, they sponsored the development of the hosting infrastructure, 
 which allows to host PostSharp easily in server environments. In May-July 
 2007, they hired me to implement PostSharp in their product. The money 
 allowed me to pack and publish the first release candidate, which was a 
 really great step!</p>
 <p>PostSharp just took too more time to be done in spare time (do you 
 realize the time it takes to support users, correct bugs, and promote the 
 project?). I am happy that our agreement will guarantee the future of 
 PostSharp.</p>
 <p>A great new for the community expecting long-term project viability!</p>
 <p>Happy PostSharping!<br>
