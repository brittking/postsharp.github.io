<p>Be seated safely before reading on. This kicks ass.</p>



<p>I have already written enough abstract words in previous posts; let&#39;s now 
introduce PostSharp 2.0 on a real example: the implementation of&nbsp; 
NotifyPropertyChanged, one of the most frequently used patterns for all adepts 
of MVC designs. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not just about implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface; it&#39;s 
also about modifying every property setter. It&#39;s deadly simple and deadly 
boring. And gets you more than one step away from the idea you have of aesthetical 
code.</p>
<p>Enough words. See the implementation using PostSharp 2.0. There&#39;s a lot of 
new concepts out there, so let&#39;s start easily:</p>
<pre>[Serializable]
[IntroduceInterface( typeof(INotifyPropertyChanged))]
public sealed class NotifyPropertyChangedAttribute : 
   InstanceLevelAspect, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public void OnPropertyChanged( string propertyName )
    {
        if ( this.PropertyChanged != null )
        {
            this.PropertyChanged( this.Instance, 
               new PropertyChangedEventArgs( propertyName ) );
        }
    }

    [IntroduceMember]
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    [OnLocationSetHandler, 
     MulticastSelector( Targets = MulticastTargets.Property )]
    public void OnPropertySet( LocationInterceptionArgs args )
    {
        if ( args.Value == args.GetCurrentValue() ) return;

        this.OnPropertyChanged( args.Location.PropertyInfo.Name );
    }
}</pre>
<p>The aspect is used this way:</p>
<pre>[NotifyPropertyChanged]
public class TestBaseClass
{
    public string PropertyA { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>Some words of explanation.</p>
<p>First, look at introductions: <i>IntroduceInterface</i> tells that the 
interface <i>INotifyPropertyChanged</i> must be introduced into the target type. 
And where is the interface implemented? Well, by the aspect itself! Note that <i>
PropertyChanged</i> is itself introduced to the target type as a public member 
thanks to the <i>IntroduceMember</i> custom attribute (without this attribute, 
the interface would be implemented explicitely). </p>
<p>The aspect actually becomes an extension of the class; aspect instances have the 
same lifetime as objects of the class to which the aspect is applied... just 
because the aspect inherits from <i>InstanceLevelAspect</i>.</p>
<p>Got it? So let&#39;s continue to the <i>OnPropertySet</i> method. It is marked by 
custom attribute <i>OnLocationSetHandler</i>: it makes this method a handler 
that intercepts all calls to the setter of all target properties. And which are 
target properties? This is told by custom attribute <i>MulticastSelector</i>: 
all properties in this case, but we could filter on name, visibility and all 
features you are used to. We could have used the same handler to handle access 
to properties (it would have turned the field to a property as a side effect).</p>
<p>Did you get it? You can now catch accesses to properties or fields using the
<i>same aspects</i>. Same semantics, same aspect. Simple, powerful.</p>
<p>Now look at the body of method <i>OnPropertySet </i>and see how easy it is to 
read the current value of the property.</p>
<p>The code above works on an isolated class, but a class is rarely isolated, 
right? More of the time, it derives from an ancestor and have descendants. What 
if the ancestor already implements interface <i>INotifyPropertyChanged</i>? The code 
above would trigger a build time error. But we can improve it. What do we want, 
by the way? Well, if the class above already implements <i>
INotifyPropertyChanged</i>, it must also have implemented a protected method <i>
OnPropertyChanged(string)</i>, and we have to invoke this method. If not, we 
define this method ourselves. In both cases, we need invoke this method from all property setters.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s turn it into code:</p>
<pre>[Serializable]
[IntroduceInterface( typeof(INotifyPropertyChanged), 
                     OverrideAction = InterfaceOverrideAction.Ignore )]
[MulticastAttributeUsage( MulticastTargets.Class, 
                          Inheritance = MulticastInheritance.Strict )]
public sealed class NotifyPropertyChangedAttribute : 
   InstanceLevelAspect, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
   
    [ImportMember( "OnPropertyChanged", IsRequired = false )] 
    public Action&lt;string&gt; BaseOnPropertyChanged;

    [IntroduceMember( Visibility = Visibility.Family, 
                      IsVirtual = true, 
                      OverrideAction = MemberOverrideAction.Ignore )]
    public void OnPropertyChanged( string propertyName )
    {
        if ( this.PropertyChanged != null )
        {
            this.PropertyChanged( this.Instance, 
               new PropertyChangedEventArgs( propertyName ) );
        }
    }

    [IntroduceMember( OverrideAction = MemberOverrideAction.Ignore )]
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    [OnLocationSetHandler, 
     MulticastSelector( Targets = MulticastTargets.Property )]
    public void OnPropertySet( LocationInterceptionArgs args )
    {
        if ( args.Value == args.GetCurrentValue() ) return;

        if ( this.BaseOnPropertyChanged != null )
        {
            this.BaseOnPropertyChanged( args.Location.PropertyInfo.Name );
        }
        else
        {
            this.OnPropertyChanged( args.Location.PropertyInfo.Name );
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>This time, the code is complete. No pedagogical simplification. Look at 
custom attributes <i>IntroduceInterface</i> and <i>IntroduceMember</i>: I have 
added an <i>OverrideAction</i>; it tells that interface and member introductions 
will be silently ignored if already implemented above.</p>
<p>Now look at field <i>BasePropertyChanged</i>: its type is <i>Action&lt;string&gt;
</i>(a delegate with signature <i>(string):void</i>) and is annotated with custom 
attribute <i>ImportMember</i>. At runtime, this field with be bound to method <i>
OnPropertyChanged</i> of the base type. If there is no such method in the base 
type, the field will simply be null. So, in method <i>OnPropertySet</i>, we can 
now choose: if there was already a method <i>OnPropertyChanged,</i> we invoke 
the existing one. Otherwise, we invoke the one we are introducing.</p>
<p>Thanks to <i>ImportMember</i>, we know how to extend a class that already 
implement the pattern. But how to make our own implementation extensible by 
derived classes? We have to introduce the method <i>OnPropertyChanged</i> and 
make it virtual. It&#39;s done, again, by custom attribute <i>IntroduceMember</i>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all. You can now use the code on class hierarchies, like here:</p>
<pre>[NotifyPropertyChanged]
public class TestBaseClass
{
    public string PropertyA { get; set; }
}</pre>
<pre>public class TestDerivedClass : TestBaseClass
{
    public int PropertyB { get; set; }
}</pre>
<pre>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        TestDerivedClass c = new TestDerivedClass();
        Post.Cast&lt;TestDerivedClass, INotifyPropertyChanged&gt;( c ).PropertyChanged += OnPropertyChanged;
        c.PropertyA = "Hello";
        c.PropertyB = 5;
    }

    private static void OnPropertyChanged( object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e )
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Property changed: {0}", e.PropertyName);
    }
}</pre>
<p>With PostSharp 1.5, you could do implement <i>easy</i> aspects easily. <b>With 
PostSharp 2.0, you can implement more complex design patterns, and it&#39;s 
still easy.</b></p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
