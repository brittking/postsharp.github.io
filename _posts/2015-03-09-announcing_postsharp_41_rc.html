<p>It&rsquo;s hot from the oven! Just this quick post to announce that PostSharp 4.1 RC is out. You can download it from NuGet (make sure to enable pre-releases) or from <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/downloads/postsharp-4.1">our web site</a>.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ll not completely repeat the previous announcements, but here is a short list of the main features:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xamarin Support</strong>, now at the same level of functionality and testing as Windows Phone. It lets you use PostSharp to build applications that target iOS and Android, additionally to Windows, Windows Phone, and Windows 8.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2015 Support</strong>, including light bulb integration, live code diagnostics and coding guidance, makes it easier to get started with PostSharp, and then assists you in more complex tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative NuGet Versioning</strong> prevents unwanted upgrades of PostSharp packages.</li>
<li><strong>PostSharp Explorer Improvements</strong> let you see where aspects are being used in your code.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Projects Support</strong> makes PostSharp integration with Visual Studio more relevant in large cross-platform projects.</li>
<li><strong>Localizable Code Contracts</strong> allow you to customize or localize the runtime exception texts thrown by code contracts.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>For more details, please see the previous <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/New-in-PostSharp-41-Improved-Visual-Studio-Tooling">release</a> <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/Announcing-PostSharp-41-Preview-4-Xamarin-Support-and-More">announcements</a>.</p>
<p>As usually, RC quality means that we consider the quality of this release to be the same as of an RTM release, with the exception of end-user testing. It also means that the <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/downloads/documentation">documentation</a> is available.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t have time to blog much more for this RC release, this is why <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/jobs/developer-evangelist">we are hiring a Developer Evangelist</a> to help us do a better job with our communication.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
