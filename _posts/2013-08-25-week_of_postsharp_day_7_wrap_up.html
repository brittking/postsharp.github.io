<p><em><a href="http://www.manning.com/baley/" target="_blank">Brownfield Application Development in .NET</a> starts by laying out the unique characteristics of brownfield apps&mdash;both negative and positive. It then systematically explores how you can employ well-established techniques like continuous integration, version control, and automated testing, even if they weren't part of the original dev process. You'll learn techniques to identify logical layers and tease apart dependencies to effectively separate concerns for improved flexibility. This practical book will help you improve not only your application's maintainability, but also the team's confidence in the project.</em></p>

The book concentrates on writing internal (textual) DSLs that allow easy extensibility of the application and framework. And if you don't know Boo, don't worry&mdash;you'll learn right here all the techniques you need.</em></p>
