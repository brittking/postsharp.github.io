<p>If you love PostSharp and would like to have it presented to your user group, this post is for you. This is not only possible, but it can also be free. Read on, or forward this post to your user group's leader...</p>


  <p>You can indeed invite me to your user groups. I can deliver one of the folling talks:</p>  <ul>  <li>&nbsp;<strong>Addressing      Non-Functional Requirements With Aspects</strong>: An introduction to      aspect-oriented programming on the .NET platform. After a funny problem      statement, I introduce some architectural views on AOP, then I compare      different AOP frameworks for .NET and explain the technologies behind (as      I am an engineer and not a commercial, I do not consider that PostSharp is      the best for all cases).</li>  <li><strong>Towards More Complex Aspects Using      PostSharp</strong>:      A live demonstration of PostSharp. We start with a simple WPF application      and progressively implement missing features using PostSharp: exception      handling, asynchronicity, and observability (data binding).</li>  <li><strong>Addressing Non-Functional      Requirements With PostSharp</strong>: a shorter version of the      previous two talks.</li>  <li><strong>Contract-First Development in .NET</strong>: an      architectural introduction to Design by Contract (TM) and concrete      examples using available .NET technologies: Code Contracts in .NET 4.0 and      validation aspects of PostSharp 1.5.</li> </ul>  <p>The talks are generally well quoted. I had a lot of speaking engagements last year (see the&nbsp;<a href="/community/talks">list</a>). As I said, I come for free as long as the session is public and free. You will 'only' have to find funds for expenses. I can also talk in commercial conferences and give micro-training sessions in companies. Please contact community@codingglove.com for details.</p>  <p>If your user group is too far from Prague, I can license my content free of charge so that you can give the talk yourself or integrate some slides into your own presentations. Details on&nbsp;<a href="/community/vip-content">this page</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;Happy PostSharping... and see you maybe physically!</p><p>-gael&nbsp;</p>
