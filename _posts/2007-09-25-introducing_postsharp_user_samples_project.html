<p>As the PostSharp community is growing, many users try PostSharp on different sample projects. There is now a places where these samples can be shared!
</p>



<p>I am pleased to introduce a new community-driven subproject of PostSharp, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-samples"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline;color:blue;">PostSharp User Samples</span></a>, hosted on Google Code.
</p>
<p>The objective of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-samples"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline;color:blue;">PostSharp User Samples</span></a> is simply to share sample codes written by community members. It's a nice way for more advanced members to help new ones. If you want to submit some sample, just communicate me the name of your google account and I will add you to the list of contributors. Then all you will need is a Subversion client.
</p>
<p>Special thanks to Gerhard Kreuzer, native Visual Basic speaker, who has already submitted a set of translated samples!
</p>
<p>However, the objective of this project is <em>not</em> to provide fully functional and tested plugins or libraries of aspects. If you own such a project, I recommend to register it in the repository of <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/community/projects"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline;color:blue;">Plug-Ins, Libraries and Related Projects</span></a>.
</p>
<p>If you have any question or comment, just let me know!
</p>
