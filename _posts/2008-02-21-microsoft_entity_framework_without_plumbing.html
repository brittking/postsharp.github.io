<p><a href="http://www.sitechno.com/Blog/">Ruurd Boeke</a> has recently released 
PostSharp4ET, a PostSharp plug-in allowing to use Microsoft Entity Framework 
without plumbing code -- PostSharp generates it for you at build-time. 
PostSharp4ET is released as a part of
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/efcontrib">Entity Framework Contrib</a> hosted 
on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/efcontrib">CodePlex.com</a>.</p>



<p>With PostSharp4ET, enabling persistency on a class should be as easy as 
decorating it with a custom attribute:</p>
<pre>[Poco(&quot;ConnectionName&quot;)]
public class Person
{
   public int PersonID { get; set; }
   public string Firstname { get; set; }
   public string Lastname { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>Under the hood, EF-specific interfaces are implemented automatically at build 
time.</p>
    <p>Ruurd
    <a href="http://www.sitechno.com/Blog/IntroducingEntityFrameworkContribEasyIPocoImplementationV01.aspx">
    explains everything extensively</a> on his blog. And even if you are not 
interested in Microsoft Entity Framework, Ruurd&#39;s blog is a great introduction 
to how to write more complex aspect libraries with PostSharp. </p>
<p>Thank you Ruurd for this excellent work!</p>
