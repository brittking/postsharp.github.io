<p>
The paper is called <strong>User-friendly aspects with compile-time semantics in .NET</strong> and insists on original contributions of PostSharp Laos to the art of aspect-oriented development.

</p><p>
I will present my work in Brussels on <a href="http://www.aosd.net/2008/program/industry.php">Wednesday, April 2th, 2008</a> and will attend the conference from Tuesday to Friday of this week.

</p><p>If anyone if interested in meeting me in Brussels, just let me know. If many are interested, we could organize a workshop on the side of the conference. Just leave a comment to this blog.

Happy aspecting!


Gael</p>
