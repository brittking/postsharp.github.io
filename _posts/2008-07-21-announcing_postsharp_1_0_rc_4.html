<p>The last release candidate was unfortunately not the final one. Last Friday I silently released a new candidate, and since there seems to be no obvious error, it's not time to announce it (I had to retract a previous tentative to public RC4 for this reason).</p>


  <p>This new RC corrects <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/tracker/search.php?project_id=1&amp;sticky_issues=on&amp;target_version=1.0+RC4&amp;sortby=last_updated&amp;dir=DESC&amp;hide_status_id=90">fourteen issues</a>, two of them required non-trivial changes requiring a new RC.</p>  <p>Maybe the best news for all is that <strong>it is now possible to apply multiple OnMethodInvocation aspects on a single method</strong>, at least with target-site weaving. I have been shamefully so far too lazy to reconsider a limitation that no longer any rationale.</p>  <p>I was however quite satisfy to notice that most bugs had pretty small coverage, so I consider already the product as very stable.</p>  <p>Unless you guys come with a new high-coverage bug requiring non-trivial refactoring, this will be the final release candidate.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>~Gael</p>
