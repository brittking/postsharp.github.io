<p>It has not happened before publishing the first release candidate in October: PostSharp has reached a zero-bug point again. This means that it is ready for a new release candidate.

</p>


<p>May I kindly ask all who have reported a bug (and all who have some minutes to loose) to download the latest build from <a href="http://download.postsharp.org/builds/1.0">http://download.postsharp.org/builds/1.0</a>. If everything is ok I will publish the RC2 next week.

</p><p>Thank you!
