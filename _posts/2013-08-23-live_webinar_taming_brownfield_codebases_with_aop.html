<p>Next week&rsquo;s guest on the PostSharp Live Webinar is <a href="file:///C:/Users/Britt.SHARPCRAFTERS/Desktop/ca.linkedin.com/in/donaldbelcham"><strong>Donald Belcham</strong></a>, a senior software developer, independent contractor, trainer, speaker and PostSharp MVP.</p>



<p>On Thursday, August 29<sup>th</sup> (09:00 PT, 12:00 ET, 16:00 GMT) Donald will speak about one of the largest challenges faced on Brownfield projects: <strong>adding project-wide functionality to a codebase.</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty comes from the tangled nature of Brownfield codebases. Finding all the locations where the functionality is needed is one thing. The bigger issue is, how do you add the new functionality without altering existing APIs or, worse, introducing defects?</p>
<p>This webinar will look at the techniques and tools that you can use to add functionality to less than inviting codebases.</p>
<p>Attendees will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Options for adding non-functional requirements</li>
<li>Areas of risk when adding non-functional requirements</li>
<li>Use of IL Weaving to add non-functional requirements</li>
<li>IL Weaving granularity</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to learn how to better tame brownfield codebases using AOP be sure to sign-up for the next PostSharp live webinar.</p>
